### Introduction
Periyar Dam  located on Periyar river in Idukki district of Kerala. The Periyar river the longest river in the states of kerala. It is one of the oldest and important dams in India. It is also known as Mullaperiyar Dam. Periyar Dam Dispute is a agnoistic issue between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, two southern states in India . It is located in Kerala but operated by the Tamil Nadu. The periyar dam was built in 1895 by british  to divert the Periyar river’s water to the dry regions of Tamil Nadu. 
It play an important role in providing water to the drought district of Tamil Nadu and particularly for watering in the Theni, Madurai, Dindigul and Sivagangai regions. This dam also supports the Hydroelectric Power generation in Tamil Nadu through the Periyar Hydroelectric project. It is also contribute in agriculture and economy , It has significantly contributed to agricultural productivity and the overall economy of Tamil Nadu, particularly by transforming dried regions into the fertile regions.
The Periyar Dam dispute brings to the forefront the delicate balance between ensuring safety and meeting water security needs. On one hand, Kerala’s concerns about the Dam’s safety and potential risks to downstream populations must be addressed to prevent objectionable consequences. On the other hand, Tamil Nadu’s reliance on the dam for irrigation, drinking water, hydroelectric power cannot be ignored . The dispute investigates the need for a nuanced approach that reconciles these competing interests , prioritizing both safety and water security. By exploring innovative solutions such as dam resettlement , water conservations and inter-state cooperation, it can work towards a resolutions.

### Background

The Periyar Dam Dispute primarily involves the southern states Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It stems from the control, maintenance, and safety of the 126 year old Periyar dam which was constructed during British rule in India. The Periyar Dam was constructed by the British colonial government under the supervision of John Pennycuick, a British engineer. The dam was built between 1887 and 1895 on the Periyar river and this was agreement between the British and the Maharaja of Travancore. 
 The British government signed a 999-year lease agreement with the Maharaja of Travancore, granting Tamil Nadu control over the dam’s operation and maintenance. And there are many agreements which are the subject of controversy and dispute between Kerala and Tamil Nadu .Over the decades, concern over the dam’s structural safety have been raised by Kerala, Kerala has argued that the dam poses a risk to downstream areas, including heavily populated regions and has advocated for reducing the water level in the dam to ensure safety. 
On the other hand Tamil Nadu argues that the dam is safe after several reinforcement and insists on maintaining the water level at 142 feet to meet the watering and drinking waters needs of its southern districts. Periyar dam dispute has been a subject of legel battles. In 2006, the Supreme court of India allowed Tamil Nadu to raised the water level to 142 feet, but Kerala passed a law to prevent the water level from being raised above 136 feet, citing safety concerns. This led to further legal conflicts. The supreme Court has been consistently involved in resolving disputes over the water level and dam safety, but no final resolutions has satisfied both parties completely. 

### Safety concerns and Water security:
The Periyar dam dispute has significant implications for water security in both Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu relies heavily on the dam for watering drinking water and industrial purposes.the dam is also a source of the drinkiwater for millions of people in southern Tamil Nadu. The dam generates the hydroelectric power, contributing to Tamil Nadu’s energy needs.
Kerala where the dam physically located, is the primarily concerned about the dam’s safety. Kerala faces water scarcity, particularly during droughts, and seeks greater control over the dam to ensure its water needs are met. In the case of mishandling, the regions downstream, including parts of kerala’s Idukki district, face the threat of flooding. This creates insecurity over both water safety and water resource and management. Kerala raises concerns about the dam’s environmental impact, including the effects on the Periyar tiger reserve and downstream ecosystems. 
This dispute highlights the need for a fair and sustainable water sharing agreement between the two states. The lack of consensus on how to manage the periyar dam diminishes trust between Tamil Nadu and Kerala making collaborative water sharing arrangements difficult. Both states have concerns about the dam’s safety and the potential risks to failure. 
And the climate change affects water availability, making it essential to address the dispute and ensure sustainable water management practices. The ongoing conflict reflects the broader challenge of managing shared water resources in a manner that balances competing needs and addresses environmental and safety concerns.

### Juidicial Aspects
The dispute has reached the Supreme Court of India multiples times. In 2006, the Supreme Court ruled that Tamil Nadu could raise the water level to 142 feet after knowing that dam structurally safe.
In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in the favour of Tamil Nadu and had allow to raise the water level 142 feet and also gave the permission that it can be 152 feet in future. And court also appointed a supervisory committee to monitor the water levels and ensure the dam’s safety.  

### Conclusion
The Periyar Dam , a 126 year old dam which are situated on the Mullayar and Periyar rivers in Kerala’s  Idukki district. But this dam operated and maintained by Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu is depend on this dam’s water and on the other hand Kerala has raised concerns about the dam’s safety. Kerala wants Tamil Nadu to undertake repairs and strengthening works to ensure the dam’s stability.
The government of these two states should to come with each other and they should talk about this old controversial topic and find a proper solution on it.
