While the idea holds promise, several hurdles we must to know. There are many challenges in this one nation one election and also concerns we shall be aware of this challenges like in this process it will be faced with constitutional challenge.
 Article 356 to facilitate simultaneous elections, changes needed to enable Union Government to dissolve state assemblies. Article 368 changes needed to ensure constitutional validity. State autonomy, will simultaneous polls compromise state governments Independence? However, the states assemblies can only be dissolved for specific reasons that are in accordance with article 356 of the constitution and dissolving the assemblies for simultaneous elections would be a violation of the constitution.  
The idea of one nation one election, has been met with scepticism by opposition parties. They argue that the proposal could benefit the ruling national party by amplifying its resources and narrative, especially in media and limit the visibility of regional parties. Smaller or regional parties may feel that simultaneous elections put them at a disadvantage when competing against larger national parties with more resources. 
Conducting simultaneous elections in a country as large and diverse as India, with over a billion people is an enormous logistical challenge. Logistical complexities of one nation one election is various like election machinery shortage of electronic voting machine, inadequate staff for simultaneous polls. Voter lists and rolls updating and synchronizing voter lists.
